## Electricity Cost Forecasting: An Application of Time-series Econometrics with R

### Problem Statement
Company XX, a medium-sized nail manufacturing company, requires accurate forecasts for its electricity costs to effectively manage its budget. At the time, they relied on a simple rolling average (SMA) model with a 12-month window in an Excel workbook. 

However, this approach frequently yielded forecasts that did not seem sensible since the time series data exhibited various patterns, including trends and seasonality. SMAs can be sluggish in responding to abrupt market shifts due to their equal weighting of data points and may not accurately capture non-linear trends or seasonal fluctuations.

Thus, the aim is to develop a time-series methodology to improve the accuracy of the budget forecast.
